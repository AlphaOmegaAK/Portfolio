      <!-- Service 1 -->
      <div class="service" id="services">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Create wireframe concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire,
          inform,
          and captivate consumers. I can develop the overall layout and production design for applications such as
          advertisements,
          brochures, magazines, web pages -single or multi page, and reports</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Service 2 -->
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Research, implement and manage software programs. Identify areas for modification in existing programs and
          subsequently develop these modifications. Determine operational practicality. Maintain and upgrade
          existing systems. Working closely with other developers, UX designers, business and systems analysts. </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Service 3 -->
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>Locate existing and potential errors in code to prevent any unexpected behaviors, crashes resulting in down
          time. When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one
          module may cause
          more bugs to appear in another. Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it. Isolate the
          source code of the problem, report, research, and you guessed it "de-bug".</p>

  <section class="about-me" id="about">
    <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am ...</h2>
    <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">
      A Full Stack Web Developer based out of Connecticut
    </p>
    <div class="about-me__body">
      <p>My story begins in Konopki Nowe, a rural town in north eastern Poland where self discipline and diligence were instilled early on. I spent the first decade of my life helping out on my family's farm where together we were a self sufficient team. During my adolescence my mother was lucky enough to win a lottery visa which afforded our family the opportunity to uncover the American Dream.</p>
      <p>Life in the states initially came with a culture shock. I had to adapt to a change in climate, culture and language. As a teen, I found my niche in school sports, specifically my high school football team. Similarly to the farm, football set the stage to be a part of a results oriented collaboration. We managed to fulfil specific roles that together bridged us to success. Although football will always be a passion of mine, my dream of making it a career was ended by a shoulder injury.
      </p>
      <p> During my recovery I spent much of my free time exploring graphic arts, software development and CADD. Although I always had an interest in computers, I hadn’t considered a career in the field. I instead pursued the automotive field in both mechanics and restoration.
 </p>
      <p>
       I spent the next 10 years of my life restoring classic cars throughout both the East Coast and West Coast but ended up in the midst of another stroke of bad luck… or so I thought. As a result of the economic impact of COVID-19 I was laid off. Home with more time on my hands than ever, I found myself at the keyboard again. In response to the pandemic, many universities began to offer free online courses in software development. My fascination with technology was reignited once more. I found myself  unable to step away from a computer screen.  After a period of time learning software development on my own, I decided to take a structured course, where I would learn from experienced professionals how to take my passion for software development turn it into a career.  I graduated from General Assembly's Software Immersive Program where I now know for certain from the knowledge I have gained and continue to build upon, that I can be a part of a technological revolution.
