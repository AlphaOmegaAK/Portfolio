      <!-- Service 1 -->
      <div class="service" id="services">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Create wireframe concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire,
          inform,
          and captivate consumers. I can develop the overall layout and production design for applications such as
          advertisements,
          brochures, magazines, web pages -single or multi page, and reports</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Service 2 -->
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Research, implement and manage software programs. Identify areas for modification in existing programs and
          subsequently develop these modifications. Determine operational practicality. Maintain and upgrade
          existing systems. Working closely with other developers, UX designers, business and systems analysts. </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Service 3 -->
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>Locate existing and potential errors in code to prevent any unexpected behaviors, crashes resulting in down
          time. When various subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one
          module may cause
          more bugs to appear in another. Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it. Isolate the
          source code of the problem, report, research, and you guessed it "de-bug".</p>

  <!-- About -->
  <section class="about-me" id="about">
    <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am ...</h2>
    <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">
      A Full Stack Web Developer based out of Connecticut
    </p>
    <div class="about-me__body">
      <p>To start off I believe it would be best to start from the very beginning, I was born and raised on a farm in
        Eastern
        European country named Poland, came to America in the late 1990's and began not only my freedom of oppression,
        but also
        began my fight for the "American Dream", thanks to my mother defying the odds my mother ended up winning a
        Visa-Lottery
        securing out families future.</p>
      <p>My story doesn't really begin to take flight; like most, until high school. Where I not only learned from
        books, but
        also from taking part in our schools football team. Where I learned the importance of hardwork, persistence, and
        most
        importantly teamwork. I was able to start varsity my freshman year and senior year become an all state player.
        But life
        isn't a disney story and all good things eventually come to an end at least for me. I ended up having to let go
        of my
        love of the spot due to a shoulder injury.
      </p>
      <p> With the a lot of time on my hands, and nothing to do I ended up picking up graphic arts, and CADD. Which
        sparked my
        interest into computers. This mixed with my natural knack of wanting to break things down and see how they work
        and what
        makes them tick, led me to software development. The only problem was I didn't have direction and my passion was
        just
        taken from me,Â  drive extinguished. That new fold love was left just out of reach. Like Romeo and Juliet. </p>
      <p>
        I ended up becoming a automotive technician for some time, but before long my passion for design, art, and
        desires of my
        work making a true difference and be seen. I picked up a spray gun. This led me down the road of not only
        working
        restoring and painting some of the world's rarest classic cars but also working on artwork of world renown
        artists. Even
        this didn't satisfy my desire to make a difference; I was making a difference but not in the sense I wanted to.
        So I let
        everything go and made a full on effort into becoming a software engineer you see today.
